It is written to work over LAN, with one computer as a server, and any number of clients connecting to it. It is written in Python 3. There is also a Mac '.app' version of the client that doesn't require Python 3 to be installed.\r\n\r\nIf you just want to download the Client or Server for your platform, you can find them under \"PeterMaar-NetLrnChatBot/Distribute/PeterMaarNetworkedChatClient\" either on the GitHub project, or in the downloaded archive.\r\n\r\n[ ![Codeship Status for alset333/NetworkedLearningChatbot](https://codeship.com/projects/63cce800-9cf2-0133-b2d9-0231463e1316/status?branch=master)](https://codeship.com/projects/127306)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
